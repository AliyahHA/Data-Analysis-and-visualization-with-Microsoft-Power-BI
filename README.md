# Nanodgree Courses:

1. Introduction to Data Preparation and Modeling:

Uncover the essentials of data preparation and modeling in Power BI. In this section, we delve into the Power BI ecosystem, exploring its built-in Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool and Power Query. You will acquire a solid understanding of foundational data modeling principles, delve into the basics of Data Analytics Expressions (DAX), and receive insights into troubleshooting and optimization strategies.

2. Creating Dynamic Visualizations with Power BI:

Elevate your data visualization skills with Power BI. This module covers a wide spectrum of both standard and advanced data visualization techniques. Discover how to strategically design reports around these visual elements, directing user attention to critical insights. Learn how to facilitate user navigation through various features and report pages and ensure accessibility for diverse audiences. Dive deep into the use of filters and slicers and unlock the potential of advanced features that enhance user engagement with visuals and the overall report.

3. Mastering Advanced Data Analysis:

Take your data analysis capabilities to the next level with this comprehensive module. Begin with an introduction to fundamental data analysis terms and techniques, including descriptive and inferential statistics, histograms, linear regression, and an exploration of correlation and probability concepts. After laying the groundwork in data analytics, the course transitions to M, the language of Power Query. Here, you'll acquire the skills needed to construct custom formulas as part of the data transformation process. The ultimate aim of this course is to empower students to effectively retrieve, analyze, and visualize data, enabling them to answer questions and draw meaningful conclusions.
